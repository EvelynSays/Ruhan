# Ruhan

## Curseborn

Those born on Midwinter are, by many, considered to be cursed. Looked upon as Auril's chosen, they often lead a more difficult life, bereft of acceptance. Ruhan is one of these curse-born, born in Wyrmdoom Crag among the Wyrmdoom Clan. Inside their home cave, surrounded by the bones of a long-dead white dragon, he was thrust into a world that seemed against him from the start.

Though his parents and clan raised him, their affection was always tempered by an air of detachment. His father, stoic and reserved, rarely offered praise, while his mother, though kind, often seemed burdened by the weight of his perceived curse. The clan's members, while not unkind, maintained a formal distance, often whispering about the shadow of Auril that seemed to follow him.

He worked diligently to hone his skills in combat and strived to overcome his failures through relentless effort. Many of his peers simply ignored him, until Korrak, only a year older, took to tormenting him. Any time they sparred, Korrak's agility and skill were evident as he effortlessly outmaneuvered Ruhan. During one particular match, Korrak deliberately tripped Ruhan in front of the entire clan, laughing as Ruhan fell face-first into the snow. On another occasion, Korrak mocked Ruhan’s attempts at a new combat technique, calling him “clumsy as a glacier” as he easily dodged every strike. These moments of humiliation were frequent and public, amplifying Ruhan's sense of inadequacy and fueling his determination to prove himself. 

## Rise

Ruhan's coming of age ritual, The Trial of Stone, was fast approaching, and he was confident. He had found himself with a natural skill for goat ball—thanks to his diligent training, he was stronger than the other Goliaths of his age, and any team that found him among its members also found victory. This was the beginning of his first brushes with acceptance and respect. He found his days easier and his relationships deeper as his skill in goat ball made him a respected and admired member of his community. Teams sought him out, and his once distant peers began to engage with him more genuinely. His newfound prominence even caught the eye of Orcsplitter, the clan's chieftain and a fervent goat ball enthusiast. Orcsplitter often praised Ruhan in front of the clan, further cementing his newfound status and creating opportunities for him to forge stronger bonds within the clan.

Korrak, who went through The Trial of Stone with only slight difficulties, was gifted the name "Rendstone" and used it to taunt Ruhan relentlessly, both before and after Ruhan’s ritual. Thanks to this, Ruhan entered his coming of age ritual with no doubts of his success. He faced a series of intense challenges during the Trial of Stone. The trial began with disorienting auditory and visual hallucinations designed to test his resolve and sanity. Shadows twisted into menacing forms, and eerie whispers filled his ears, threatening to break his focus. Despite these trials, Ruhan pressed on, his determination unwavering. He finally crawled through the narrow, rune-carved tunnel, a symbolic passage that represented his transition from youth to adulthood. At the end of the tunnel, he placed a doll at the cave's entrance, a token of his childhood, and made a solemn vow to embrace his new role as a grown Goliath.

Upon leaving the cave, he was given the nickname "Curseborn" by the chieftain and felt a mix of pride and shame. He had been given a name, but his clan still remembered him foremost for the circumstances of his birth.


## Stability

As the years passed, Ruhan devoted himself entirely to the pursuit of acceptance. He never turned down anything asked of him, whether it was menial labor, dangerous expeditions, 'friendly' sparring matches, or simply standing watch. His strength increased significantly with age, and he became known as a reliable and steadfast member of the clan.

He spent decades carving out his place, paving his journey with numerous successes and displays of impressive strength. Ruhan played a crucial role in several significant clan projects and initiatives, demonstrating his leadership and problem-solving skills in various critical situations. His remarkable endurance and bravery in facing numerous challenges solidified his reputation as a dependable and respected member of the clan.

On his 30th year, he was honored with the name "Stonewarden," having finally proven himself as a stalwart, determined protector of his people. Even Korrak, now known as Rendstone, had come to accept him, and the two often hunted together, finding value in each other’s strengths—Ruhan’s formidable power and Rendstone’s swift agility.

Time passed, and feeling that he had finally secured his place within the clan, Ruhan was content. His greatest happiness came later, when he forged a deep bond with a younger clan member, Kolgarak, orphaned by a failed hunt that had claimed both his parents, was initially a withdrawn and grieving young member of the clan. Ruhan noticed Kolgarak’s struggle and decided to take him under his wing. He provided Kolgarak with both emotional support and practical training, teaching him to fight and how to survive the harsh conditions of Icewind Dale. Ruhan also helped Kolgarak develop his skills in crafting and tracking, crucial abilities for the clan’s survival. As Kolgarak matured, he grew into a confident and skilled warrior, thanks in large part to Ruhan’s guidance and the bond they had forged. This mentorship not only helped Kolgarak find his place within the clan but also solidified a lasting friendship between them.

When Kolgarak reached his coming of age, he underwent the Trial of Stone and, thanks to his promising strength and Ruhan’s guidance, was honored with the name "Dawnstone."

## Fall

One long winter night, Ruhan was asked to lead a hunt to replenish the dwindling meat stores. It was typical for this time of year for most clan members to be busy—working in some way or another to help the clan survive the harsh winter. As usual, Dawnstone requested to accompany him. Given the particularly challenging conditions, Ruhan sought out Rendstone as well, and the three of them ventured out in search of food.

After a successful hunt for elk, the three were making their way back to the caves when they were ambushed by a pack of desperate, starving wolves. The wolves attacked with frenzied aggression, driven by their extreme hunger and the harsh winter conditions. Their ferocity and speed caught the trio off guard, turning a simple return trip into a brutal fight for survival. Rendstone engaged the lone direwolf among them, while Dawnstone was caught off guard and pinned into the snow. Wolves also surrounded Ruhan, with one clamping down on his hand while others tried to bring him down. Despite the onslaught, Ruhan managed to shrug off the wolves, dropping his greataxe and using it to pry the wolves away from Dawnstone, who was severely injured. He pinned the wolf still biting his hand to the ground with his foot, ripped his trapped hand free, and struck down several wolves with a handaxe he drew from his waist. Seeing Rendstone defeat the direwolf and Ruhan dispatching several others, the remaining wolves retreated. Dawnstone managed to get to his knees and gestured to Ruhan's left hand—his ring and middle fingers had been severely damaged. Ruhan cleaned his axe in the snow, placed his hand against a tree, and severed the damaged fingers at the base, wrapping them to stop the bleeding. The three of them made their way back with their supplies, and Ruhan thought little of the incident once it was clear that Dawnstone would recover fully.

A few nights later, Orcsplitter approached Ruhan with several other clan members—including Rendstone and Dawnstone. The chieftain spoke of the incident with clear disdain, his voice cutting through the silence of the night. Ruhan felt a deep pang of betrayal as he realized that his decision to prioritize Dawnstone’s safety over killing the wolves had violated an ancient tradition. The cold judgment in Orcsplitter's eyes and the smug satisfaction on Rendstone’s face made Ruhan’s heart sink. Dawnstone, though visibly pained, did not lie when questioned. In that moment, Ruhan felt a crushing weight of rejection as he was stripped of his name, "Stonewarden." The realization that the clan had never truly accepted him, and that they had waited for an opportunity to exile him, was a bitter blow that left him feeling both isolated and betrayed

## Auril

Surviving alone was difficult. The only benefit of his curse was that he managed to withstand the cold on that first night. He sustained himself through hunting and sleeping in caves—slaying a bear here and there if it dared to claim the cave as its own. Not wanting to be found by either his clan or the rival Skytower clan, he ventured away from the Spine into the Dales.

On a clear, cold night, he saw her. Auril, atop her Roc, soaring through the sky of the Dales.Seeing Auril soaring above him on her Roc ignited a searing rage within Ruhan. The sight of her—a symbol of the power and influence he felt had cursed his existence—was a constant reminder of his failures and isolation. He was not only angry at her for the perceived mockery but also furious with himself for being in such a dire situation. This rage became a driving force, pushing him beyond his limits in a frantic, reckless bid for survival. He believed that by confronting or somehow connecting with Auril, he could prove his worth and defy the fate he felt had been unjustly thrust upon him. 

He exhausted himself more than he should have, exposing himself recklessly to the biting winds and pushing his limits when he knew he needed to rest. Driven only by his desire to survive and the realization of his grave error, he headed toward a distant light. Knowing he had no other choice to endure the night, he made his way toward one of the towns of the Dale, hoping to find refuge and escape the relentless cold.
